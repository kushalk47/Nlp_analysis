    "Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its **base or dictionary form (lemma)** while considering its meaning and context. Itâ€™s different from stemming because lemmatization returns meaningful words, whereas stemming may produce non-existent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "| Word | Lemmatized Form |\n",
    "|------|----------------|\n",
    "| Running | Run |\n",
    "| Better  | Good |\n",
    "| Cars    | Car |\n",
    "| Was     | Be |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Lemmatization?**\n",
    "- Improves NLP accuracy by keeping words meaningful.\n",
    "- Helps in text analysis, sentiment analysis, and search engines.\n",

    "### **How to Perform Lemmatization in Python?**\n",
    "You can use **NLTKâ€™s WordNetLemmatizer**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n",
    "from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n",
    "import nltk\n",

    "print(lemmatized_text)  \n",
    "# Output: ['The', 'cat', 'are', 'running', 'faster', 'than', 'the', 'dog', '.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `\"cats\"` â†’ `\"cat\"`, but `\"running\"` is not lemmatized because we didnâ€™t specify the **part of speech (POS)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lemmatized_text = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos=\"v\") for word in tokens]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This considers verbs and will lemmatize `\"running\"` â†’ `\"run\"`.\n",
